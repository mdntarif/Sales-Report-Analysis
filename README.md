- **Products**: CSV/Database.

### **ðŸ”— Data Modelling**  
- Combined multiple data files into a single table for analysis.  
- Cleaned and formatted data for consistency (e.g., splitting city and country, fixing dates).  
- Linked all data tables using keys for seamless analysis.

### **ðŸ“ˆ Insights and Analysis**  
- Calculated key metrics like **Total Revenue**, **Total Cost**, and **Gross Profit**.

### **ðŸ’¡ Challenges I Faced**  
1. **Combining Data:** Merging data from different files was tricky and needed a lot of cleaning.  
2. **Visual Design:** Ensuring the dashboard is both functional and visually appealing took extra effort.  
3. **Sorting Dates:** Getting months in the correct order (Jan-Dec) was more complex than expected.
